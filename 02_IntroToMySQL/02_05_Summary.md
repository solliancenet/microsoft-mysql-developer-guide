## 02 / Summary

This module explained common use cases for MySQL and illustrated the typical IaaS and PaaS approaches plus additional hybrid approaches to hosting MySQL applications and databases on Microsoft Azure. Moreover, this module introduced the core approaches to managing Microsoft Azure resources including imperative tools (like the Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell) and declarative tools (like ARM templates and Terraform).

The emphasis of this guide will continue to be on the advantages of Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server versus the single server offering. Flexible Server is the preferred Azure Database for MySQL offering, therefore this guide will continue to reiterate the unique benefits of Flexible Server throughout the remainder of this guide but also provide references to Single Server where necessary and appropriate.
