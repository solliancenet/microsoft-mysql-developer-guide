# What is MySQL?

MySQL is a relational database management system based on [SQL – Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). MySQL supports a rich set of SQL query capabilities and offers excellent performance through storage engines optimized for transactional and non-transactional workloads, in-memory processing, and robust server configuration through modules. Its low total cost of ownership makes it extremely popular with many organizations. Customers can use their existing frameworks and languages to connect easily with a MySQL database. Consult the [MySQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/features.html) for a more in-depth review of MySQL's features.  

One of the most common use cases for MySQL databases is web applications that need data persistence. Due to MySQL's scalability, popular content management systems, such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) utilize it for their data persistence. More broadly, [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) apps, which integrate Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP, leverage scalable web servers, languages, and database engines to serve a large set of global web services.

## Comparison with other RDBMS offerings

Though MySQL has a distinct set of advantages, it does compete with other common relational database offerings. Though the emphasis of this guide is operating MySQL on Azure to architect scalable applications, it is important to be aware of other potential offerings such as [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/). MariaDB is a fork from the original MySQL code base when [Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/college-recruiting/projects/mysql.html#.YexR-P7ML8o).

While MariaDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol, the project is not managed by Oracle, and its maintainers claim that this allows them to better compete with other proprietary databases. Although you have several options to choose from, MySQL has over twenty years of development experience backing it, and businesses appreciate the platform's maturity.

Another popular open-source MySQL competitor is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). MySQL supports many of the advanced features of PostgreSQL, such as JSON storage, replication and failover, and partitioning, in an easy-to-use manner. Microsoft offers cloud-hosted [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/overview), which you can compare with cloud-hosted MySQL [in Microsoft Learn.](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/deploy-mariadb-mysql-postgresql-azure/2-describe-open-source-offerings)

## MySQL hosting options

MySQL has multiple deployment options for development and production environments alike.

### On-premises

MySQL is a cross-platform offering, and corporations can utilize their on-premises hardware to deploy highly-available MySQL configurations. MySQL on-premises deployments are highly configurable, but they require significant upfront hardware capital expenditure and have the disadvantages of hardware/OS maintenance.

One benefit to choosing a cloud-hosted environment is there are no large upfront costs. You have the option to pay monthly subscription fees as you go or to commit to a certain usage level for discounts. Maintenance, up-to-date software, security, and support all fall into the responsibility of the cloud provider so IT staff are not required to utilize precious time troubleshooting hardware or software issues.

### Cloud IaaS (in a VM)

Migrating your organization's infrastructure to an IaaS solution helps you reduce maintenance of on-premises data centers, save money on hardware costs, and gain real-time business insights. IaaS solutions give you the flexibility to scale your IT resources up and down with demand. They also help you quickly provision new applications and increase the reliability of your underlying infrastructure.

IaaS lets you bypass the cost and complexity of buying and managing physical servers and datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only pay for a particular resource for as long as you need it. A cloud computing service provider like Azure manages the infrastructure, while you purchase, install, configure, and manage your own software—including operating systems, middleware, and applications.

### Containers

While much more lightweight, containers are similar to VMs, and you can start and stop them in a few seconds. Containers also offer tremendous portability, which makes them ideal for developing an application locally on your machine and then hosting it in the cloud, in test, and later in production. You can even run containers on-premises or in other clouds. This is possible because the environment that you use on your development machine travels with your container, so your application always runs in the same way. Containerized applications are flexible, cost-effective, and deploy quickly.

MySQL offers a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) to operate MySQL in containerized applications. Containerized MySQL can persist data to the machine with the Docker runtime, and it can even operate from an existing MySQL data directory.

### Cloud PaaS

MySQL databases can be deployed on public cloud platforms by utilizing VMs or Kubernetes. However, these platforms offer their own managed MySQL products, such as Amazon RDS for MySQL and Google Cloud SQL for MySQL.
