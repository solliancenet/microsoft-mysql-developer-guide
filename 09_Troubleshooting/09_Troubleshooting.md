# Troubleshooting

As applications are running and executing in the cloud environment it is always a possibility that something unexpected will occur. This section details a few common troubleshooting steps.

## Common MySQL issues

### Network connectivity issues

- By default, Flexible Server only supports encrypted connections through the TLS 1.2 protocol; clients using TLS 1.0 or 1.1 will be unable to connect unless explicitly enabled. If it is not possible to change the TLS protocol used by an application, then [change the Flexible Server instance's supported TLS versions.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl)

- If connecting to Flexible Server via public access, ensure that firewall ACLs permit access from the client.

- Ensure that corporate firewalls do not block outbound connections to port 3306.

- Use a fully qualified domain name instead of an IP address in connection strings.

### Resource issues

- If the application experiences transient connectivity issues, perhaps the resources of the Flexible Server instance are constrained. Monitor resource usage and determine whether the Flexible Server instance needs to be scaled up.

### Platform issues

- On occasion, Azure experiences outages. Use [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/) to determine if an Azure outage impacts MySQL workloads.

- Azure's periodic updates can impact the availability of applications. Flexible Server allows administrators [to set custom maintenance schedules.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-maintenance)

## Troubleshoot app issues in Azure App Service

- **Enable web logging.** Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with [debugging an App Service app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs).
- Network requests taking a long time? [Troubleshoot slow app performance issues in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-performance-degradation)
- In Azure App Service, certain settings are available to the deployment or runtime environment as environment variables. Some of these settings can be customized when configuring the app settings.

## General issue mitigation

Generally, all cloud applications should include connection [retry logic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/retry), which typically responds to transient issues by initiating subsequent connections after a delay.

If none of the above resolve the issue with the MySQL instance, [send a support request from the Azure portal.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview)
