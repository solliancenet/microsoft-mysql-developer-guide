# 09 / Troubleshooting

As applications are running and executing in cloud environments it is always a possibility that something unexpected will occur. This section details a few common troubleshooting steps.

## Common MySQL issues
Debugging operational support issues can be really time consuming. Setting up the right monitoring and alerting can help provide useful error messages and clues to the problem areas.

### Network connectivity issues

- By default, Flexible Server only supports encrypted connections through the TLS 1.2 protocol; clients using TLS 1.0 or 1.1 will be unable to connect unless explicitly enabled. If it is not possible to change the TLS protocol used by an application, then [change the Flexible Server instance's supported TLS versions.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/how-to-connect-tls-ssl)

- If connecting to Flexible Server via public access, ensure that firewall ACLs permit access from the client.

- Ensure that corporate firewalls do not block outbound connections to port 3306.

- Use a fully qualified domain name instead of an IP address in connection strings.

- Use [Azure Network Watcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview) to debug traffic flows in virtual networks. Note that it does not support PaaS services, but it is still a useful tool for IaaS configurations
  - Network Watcher works well with other networking utilities, like the Unix `traceroute` tool

### Resource issues

- If the application experiences transient connectivity issues, perhaps the resources of the Flexible Server instance are constrained. Monitor resource usage and determine whether the Flexible Server instance needs to be scaled up.

### Platform issues

- On occasion, Azure experiences outages. Use [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/) to determine if an Azure outage impacts MySQL workloads in your region or datacenter.

- Azure's periodic updates can impact the availability of applications. Flexible Server allows administrators [to set custom maintenance schedules.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-maintenance)

- Implement retry logic to mitigate transient connectivity issues
  - To provide resiliency against more severe failures, like Azure service outages, implement the [circuit breaker pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) to avoid wasting application resources on operations that are likely to fail

## Troubleshoot app issues in Azure App Service

- **Enable web logging.** Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with [debugging an App Service app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs).
- Network requests taking a long time? [Troubleshoot slow app performance issues in Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-performance-degradation)
- In Azure App Service, certain settings are available to the deployment or runtime environment as environment variables. Some of these settings can be customized when configuring the app settings.

## General issue mitigation

Generally, all cloud applications should include connection [retry logic](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/patterns/retry), which typically responds to transient issues by initiating subsequent connections after a delay.

If none of the above resolve the issue with the MySQL instance, [send a support request from the Azure portal.](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview)
