# 13 / Zero to Hero

As we approach the end to this developer guide, hopefully it is now possible to assess where in the application and MySQL instance evolution the target environment may be and then using that waypoint, determine what things are needed to take the application architecture to the next level in the evolutionary progression.

## Determining the evolutionary waypoint

In module 4, we explored an evolution from classic development and deployment to current modern methods.  It is important to understand where the current position and where it will be in the future.

## Summary of tasks

- Have the right tools available
- Determine how to deploy the application
- Utilize code repositories with CI/CD enabled
- Ensure the target environment is configured to support the workload(s)
- Secure the application configurations
- Secure the database configurations
- Secure the virtual networks
- Monitor the applications and database workloads for performance
- Perform regular testing
- Ensure up policies and procedures are setup and configured for auditing application and database workloads
- Setup backup and restore based on RTO and RPO objectives
- Be familiar with potential issues and how to remediate them
