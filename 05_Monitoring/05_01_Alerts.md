# Alerting

## Concepts

Once you have created your KQL queries, you will then create [log alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-unified-log) from these queries.

- **Alert rules** specify the metric to monitor (e.g. `aborted_connections`), an aggregation for that metric (e.g. the `total`), a threshold for the aggregated value (e.g. `10 connections`), a time window for the aggregation (e.g. `30 minutes`), and a polling frequency (e.g. check if the previous conditions are met every `5 minutes`)

- **Action groups** define notification actions, such as emailing or texting an administrator, and other actions to take, like calling a webhook or [Azure Automation Runbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-runbook-types)

- **Alert processing rules** is a *preview* feature that filters alerts as they are generated to modify the actions taken in response to that alert (i.e. by disabling action groups)

### Best Practices with Alerting Metrics

Here are some scenarios of how aggregating metrics over time generates insights. Read the [Microsoft blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/best-practices-for-alerting-on-metrics-with-azure-database-for-mysql-monitoring/) for more examples.

- If there were **10** or more failed connections (total of `aborted_connections` in Flexible Server) in the last **30** minutes, then send an email alert
  - This may indicate incorrect credentials or an SSL issue in the application

- If IOPS was **90%** or more of capacity (average of `io_consumption_percent` in Flexible Server) for at least **1** hour, then call a webhook
  - Excessive IO usage affects the performance of transactional workloads, so [scale storage to increase IOPS capacity or provision additional IOPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-compute-storage)
  - See the linked CLI examples for automatic scaling based on metrics
