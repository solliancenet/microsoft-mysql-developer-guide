# 05 / Monitoring

Once the application and database are deployed, the next phase is to manage the new cloud-based data workload and supporting resources. Microsoft proactively performs the necessary monitoring and actions to ensure the databases are highly available and performing at the expecting level.

Proper monitoring management helps with the following:

- Understanding the resource utilization
- Workload connection metric analysis
- Failure analysis and remediation
- Environment performance analysis and scaling adjustments
- Historical performance review

Azure Database for MySQL provides the ability to monitor all of these types of operational activities using Azure-based tools such as [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview), [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/design-logs-deployment), and [Azure Sentinel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/overview). In addition to the Azure-based tools, external security information and event management (SIEM) systems can be configured to consume these logs as well.

Alerts should be created to warn administrators of outages, operational performance problems, or any suspicious activity. If a particular alert event has a well-defined remediation path, alerts can fire automated [Azure runbooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/automation/automation-quickstart-create-runbook) to address and resolve the event automatically.

The following section content will be focused on these monitoring concepts:

- Azure Monitor overview and strategy

- Application monitoring

- Database monitoring

## Azure Monitor overview

Azure Monitor is the Azure native platform service that provides a centralized area for monitoring your Azure resources. It monitors all layers of the Azure stack, starting with tenant services, such as Azure Active Directory, subscription-level events and Azure Service Health.

At the lower levels, it monitors infrastructure resources, such as VMs, storage, and network resources. Administrators and developers employ Azure Monitor to consolidate metrics about the performance and reliability of their various cloud layers, including Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instances. Management tools, such as those in Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Azure Automation, also push log data to Azure Monitor. The service aggregates and stores this telemetry in a log data store thatâ€™s optimized for cost and performance.

For more information on what can be monitored, read: [What is monitored by Azure Monitor?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/monitor-reference)

Monitoring your Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instances allows you to understand database resource constraints, connectivity patterns, causes of application failures, and more.

Once you specify the data that your Azure resource(s) should monitor (varies based on the service), you need to direct that data to a place that Azure Monitor can monitor. For example, with MySQL Flexible Server instances, you can use the **Diagnostic setting** tab of the Azure portal to route MySQL slow query logs and audit logs to Log Analytics workspaces (Azure Monitor Logs).

![This image demonstrates the Diagnostic setting tab of Azure portal to set the destination for logs.](./media/diagnostic-setting-tab.png "Log destination")

## Define your strategy

Administrators should [plan their monitoring strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/best-practices-plan) and resource configuration for the best results. Some data collection and features are free while others have associated costs. Focus on maximizing your applications' performance and reliability. Identify the data and logs that indicate the highest potential signs of failure to optimize costs. See [Azure Monitor Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for more information on planning monitoring costs.

## Application monitoring

Once an application has been deployed, it is important to start to monitor the uptime and performance as well as understand usage patterns.  [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) is a feature that provides extensible application performance management (APM) and monitoring for web-based applications.

Application insights monitoring is very flexible in that it supports a wide variety of platforms, including .NET, Node.js, Java, and Python as well as apps hosted on-premises or on any public cloud. Just about any application can take advantage of this powerful monitoring tool.

Using Application Insights:

- Install a small instrumentation package (SDK) in your app
- Or enable Application Insights by using the Application Insights agent in Azure.

![](media/application-insights-overview.png)

The instrumentation code directs telemetry data to an Application Insights resource by using a unique instrumentation key and url.

Example steps to configure WordPress monitoring:

- Install Application Insights plugin from WordPress Plugins

- Create Application Insights

- Copy the Instrumentation Key from created Application Insights

- Then go to **Settings** and Application Insights inside WordPress, and add the key there.

- Access the website and look for details

> ![Tip](media/tip.png "Tip") **Tip**: [Connection Strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/sdk-connection-string?tabs=net) are recommended over instrumentation keys.

### Azure Metrics Explorer

[Azure Metrics Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started) makes it easy to capture performance counters for resources quickly without having to add instrumentation to your application code. As the following diagram shows, you simply seelct the resource and metric and then apply your filters:

![](media/azure-metrics-workflow.png)

For example, if we wanted to capture performance counters for a PHP App Service resource, there are some simple steps to follow.

- Determine your scope. Navigate to the App Service in the Azure Portal.
- In the **Monitoring** section, select the **Metrics** item.
- Select your time range.

  ![](media/azure-metric-time-range.png)

- Select your **Metric** from the dropdown.

  ![](media/mysql-guide-metric-counters.png)

- Select your chart choice for the chosen metric.

  ![](media/mysql-guide-request-count-metric.png)

- Create a rule by selecting **New alert rule**.
  
  ![](media/azure-metric-new-alert-rule.png)

### Cost

Application Insights comes with a free allowance that tends to be relatively large enough to cover development and publishing an app for a small number of users. As a best practice, setting a limit can prevent more data than necessary from being processed and keep costs low. 

Larger volumes of telemetry are charged by the gigabyte and should be monitored closely to ensure your finance department does not get a larger than expected Azure invoice. [Manage usage and costs for Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/pricing)

## Monitoring database operations

Azure Metrics can be configured to monitor the database as well.  As you can see from the following screenshot, there are many metrics available out of the box that can be monitored:

![](media/mysql-guide-database-metric-example.png)

In addition to the views in Azure Monitor, log data collected can be sent to Log Analytics workspaces and then analyzed with [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) queries to quickly retrieve, consolidate, and analyze collected data.

Administrators unfamiliar with KQL can find a SQL to KQL cheat sheet [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/sqlcheatsheet) or the [Get started with log queries in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/get-started-queries) page.

For example, to get the memory usage of the Azure Database for MySQL:

```kql
AzureMetrics
| where TimeGenerated > ago(15m)
| limit 10
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.DBFORMYSQL"
| where MetricName == "memory_percent"
| project TimeGenerated, Total, Maximum, Minimum, TimeGrain, UnitName
| top 1 by TimeGenerated
```

To get the CPU usage:

```kql
AzureMetrics
| where TimeGenerated > ago(15m)
| limit 10
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.DBFORMYSQL"
| where MetricName == "cpu_percent"
| project TimeGenerated, Total, Maximum, Minimum, TimeGrain, UnitName
| top 1 by TimeGenerated
```

!["The results from an Azure Metrics query are displayed"](./media/AzureMetrics_query_cpu.png "The results from an Azure Metrics query are displayed")

The table below, pulled from the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-monitoring), indicates the metrics exposed by Flexible Server instances:

|Metric display name|Metric|Unit|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|Host CPU percent|cpu_percent|Percent|The percentage of CPU utilization on the server, including CPU utilization from both customer workload and Azure MySQL processes|
|Host Network In |network_bytes_ingress|Bytes|Incoming network traffic on the server, including traffic from both customer database and Azure MySQL features like replication, monitoring, logs, etc.|
|Host Network out|network_bytes_egress|Bytes|Outgoing network traffic on the server, including traffic from both customer database and Azure MySQL features like replication, monitoring, logs, etc.|
|Replication Lag|replication_lag|Seconds|The time since the last replayed transaction. This metric is available for replica servers only.|
|Active Connections|active_connection|Count|The number of active connections to the server.|
|Backup Storage Used|backup_storage_used|Bytes|The amount of backup storage used.|
|IO percent|io_consumption_percent|Percent|The percentage of IO in use.|
|Host Memory Percent|memory_percent|Percent|The percentage of memory in use on the server, including memory utilization from both customer workload and Azure MySQL processes|
|Storage Limit|storage_limit|Bytes|The maximum storage for this server.|
|Storage Percent|storage_percent|Percent|The percentage of storage used out of the server's maximum.|
|Storage Used|storage_used|Bytes|The amount of storage in use. The storage used by the service may include the database files, transaction logs, and server logs.|
|Total connections|total_connections|Count|The number of total connections to the server|
|Aborted Connections|aborted_connections|Count|The number of failed attempts to connect to MySQL, for example, failed connection due to bad credentials.|
|Queries|queries|Count|The number of queries per second|

## Query Performance Insights

In addition to the basic server monitoring aspects, Azure provides tools to monitor application query performance.  Correcting or improving queries can lead to significant increases in the query throughput. Use the [Query Performance Insight tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/tutorial-query-performance-insights) to analyze the longest-running queries and determine if it is possible to cache those items if they are deterministic within a set period, or modify the queries to increase their performance.

In addition to the query performance insight tool, `Wait statistics` provides a view of the wait events that occur during the execution of a specific query.

>![Warning](media/warning.png "Warning") **Warning**: Wait statistics are meant for troubleshooting query performance issues. It is recommended to be turned on only for troubleshooting purposes.

Finally, the `slow_query_log` can be set to show slow queries in the MySQL log files (default is OFF). The `long_query_time` server parameter can be used to log long-running queries (default long query time is 10 sec).

## Server Logs

Server logs from Azure Databse for MySQL can also be extracted through the Azure platform *resource logs*, which track data plane events. Azure can route these logs to Log Analytics workspaces for manipulation and visualization through KQL.

In addition to Log Analytics, the data can also be routed to Event Hubs for third-party integrations and Azure storage for long term backup.

## MySQL audit logs

MySQL has a robust built-in audit log feature. By default, this [audit log feature is disabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-audit-logs) in Azure Database for MySQL.  Server level logging can be enabled by changing the `audit_log_enabled` server parameter. Once enabled, logs can be accessed through [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview) and [Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/design-logs-deployment) by turning on [diagnostic logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/tutorial-configure-audit#set-up-diagnostics).

In addition to metrics, it is also possible to enable MySQL logs to be ingested into Azure Monitor. While metrics are better suited for real-time decision-making, logs are also useful for deriving insights. One source of logs generated by Flexible Server is MySQL *audit logs*, which indicate connections, DDL and DML operations, and more. Many businesses utilize audit logs to meet compliance requirements, but they can impact performance.

Once enabled, KQL can be used to query the logs. For example, to query for user connection related events, run the following KQL query:

```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider =="MICROSOFT.DBFORMYSQL"
| where Category == 'MySqlAuditLogs' and event_class_s == "connection_log"
| project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, event_subclass_s, event_time_t, user_s , ip_s , sql_text_s
| order by TimeGenerated asc
```

>![Warning](media/warning.png "Warning") **Warning**: Excessive audit logging can degrade server performance, so be mindful of the events and users configured for logging.

### Enabling audit logs

Audit logging is controlled by the `audit_log_enabled` server parameter in Flexible Server. Azure provides granularity over the events logged (`audit_log_events`), the database users subject to logging (`audit_log_include_users`), and an explicit list of the database users exempt from logging (`audit_log_exclude_users`).

> For more details about the logging server parameters, including the type of events that can be logged, consult [the documentation.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/concepts-audit-logs)

Reference [Configure and access audit logs for Azure Database for MySQL in the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/howto-configure-audit-logs-portal) for more information.

## Azure Service Health

[Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/) notifies administrators about Azure service incidents and planned maintenance so actions can be taken to mitigate downtime. Configure customizable cloud alerts and use personalized dashboards to analyze health issues, monitor the impact to cloud resources, get guidance and support, and share details and updates.
