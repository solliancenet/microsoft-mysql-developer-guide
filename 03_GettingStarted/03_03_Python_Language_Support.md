# Python Language Support

This document describes tools to interact with Azure Database for MySQL (Single Server and Flexible Server) through Python.

## Example Code

Refer to the [Connect and Query sample for Python.](./03_Connect_Query_Python.md)

## Application Connectors

*MySQL Connector/Python* offers a Python Database API specification-compatible driver for MySQL database access (PEP 249). It does not depend on a MySQL client library. The Python Connect and Query sample utilizes *MySQL Connector/Python*.

An alternative connector is *PyMySQL*. It is also PEP 249-compliant.

Django is a popular web application framework for Python. The Django ORM officially supports MySQL through (1) the *mysqlclient* Python wrapper for the native MySQL driver or (2) the *MySQL Connector/Python* API. *mysqlclient* is recommended for use with the Django ORM.

Flexible Server is compatible with all Python client utilities for MySQL Community Edition. However, Microsoft has only validated *MySQL Connector/Python* and *PyMySQL* for use with Single Server due to its network connectivity setup. Refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/concepts-compatibility) document for more information about drivers compatible with Single Server.
