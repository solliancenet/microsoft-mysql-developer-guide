# PHP Language Support

This document describes tools to interact with Azure Database for MySQL (Single Server and Flexible Server) through PHP.

## Example Code

Refer to the [Connect and Query sample for PHP.](./03_Connect_Query_PHP.md)

## Application Connectors

There are two major APIs to interact with MySQL in PHP: *MySQLi*, which is used in the Connect and Query sample, and *PDO*, which is used in the Laravel sample food ordering site. *MySQLi* and *PDO* are wrappers over the *mysqlnd* or *libmysqlclient* C libraries: it is highly recommended to use *mysqlnd* as the default backend library due to its more advanced features. *mysqlnd* is the default backend provided with PHP.

*MySQLi* is an improvement over the earlier *MySQL* API, which does not meet the security needs of modern applications.

*PDO*, or *PHP Data Objects*, allows applications to access databases in PHP through abstractions, standardizing data access for different databases. PDO works with a database-specific driver, like *PDO_MYSQL*.

Flexible Server and Single Server are compatible with all PHP client utilities for MySQL Community Edition.
