## PHP language support

This section describes tools to interact with Azure Database for MySQL (Single Server and Flexible Server) through PHP.

### Example code

Refer to the [Connect and query Azure Database for MySQL using PHP] application for examples of how to use PHP to connect to MySQL.

### Application connectors

There are two major APIs to interact with MySQL in PHP:

- *MySQLi*, *MySQLi* is an improvement over the earlier *MySQL* API, which does not meet the security needs of modern applications.
- *PDO*, or *PHP Data Objects*, allows applications to access databases in PHP through abstractions, standardizing data access for different databases. PDO works with a database-specific driver, like *PDO_MYSQL*.

> **Note** *MySQLi* and *PDO* are wrappers over the *mysqlnd* or *libmysqlclient* C libraries: it is highly recommended to use *mysqlnd* as the default backend library due to its more advanced features. *mysqlnd* is the default backend provided with PHP.

Flexible Server and Single Server are compatible with all PHP client utilities for MySQL Community Edition.
