# Query Azure Database for MySQL Using the Azure CLI

This guide explains how to perform queries against Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server using the Azure CLI and the `az mysql flexible-server` utilities.

## Setup

While the Azure sample demonstrates how to provision a Flexible Server instance using the CLI, you can follow one of the provisioning methods in the [Provision MySQL Flexible Server](./03_05_Provision_MySQL_Flexible_Server.md) document.

## Instructions

This guide is based on a [Microsoft document.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/connect-azure-cli#create-a-database) 

The Azure CLI supports running queries interactively, via the `az mysql flexible-server connect` command, which is similar to running queries interactively against a MySQL instance through the MySQL CLI. It is also possible to run an individual SQL query or a SQL file using the `az mysql flexible-server execute` command.

Note that these commands require the `rdbms-connect` CLI extension, which is automatically installed if it is not present. If you encounter permissions errors from the Azure Cloud Shell, execute the commands from a local installation of the Azure CLI.

In addition to the queries in the document, you can run basic admin queries. The statements below create a new user `analyst` that can read data from all tables in `newdatabase`.

```sql
USE newdatabase;
CREATE USER 'analyst'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '[SECURE PASSWORD]';
GRANT SELECT ON newdatabase.* TO 'analyst'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The new `analyst` user can also connect to `newdatabase` in the Flexible Server instance. The new user can only query tables in `newdatabase`.
