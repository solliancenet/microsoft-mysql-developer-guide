# End to End Development

Now that you have a development environment setup, its time to explore the various options you have to deploy your application and its corredsponding MySQL database.  

This will start with a typical classic deployment where you deploy your application to a web server and a database server on a physical or virtualized host operating system and then explore the evolution of the potential deployment options in a simple to complex progression ending with your application running as containers in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure Database for MySQL hosting your database.

## Development Evolution

The following scenerios will be discussed and demonstrated as part of this guide.  All of the following deployments will utilize the same application and database backend and what is needed to modify the application in order to support the targets.

- Classic deployment
- Azure VM Deployment
- Simple App Service Deployment with Azure Database for My SQL Single Server
- App Service with InApp MySQL
- Continous Integration / Continous Delivery
- Containerizing your layers with Docker
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- App Service Containers
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- AKS with MySQL Flexible Server
