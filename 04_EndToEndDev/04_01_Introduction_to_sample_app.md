# Introduction to the guide sample application

## Overview

ContosoNoshNow is a delivery service and logistics company focused on making delicious food accessible to their customers no matter where they are located. The company started with a simple web application they could easily maintain and add features to as the business grew. A few years later, their CIO realized the application performance and their current on-premises environment were not meeting their business's growing demand. The application deployment process took hours, yielded unreliable results, and the admin team could not easily find production issues quickly. During the busy hours, customers complained the web application was slow.

The development team knew moving to Azure could help with these issues.

## What happens to my app during deployment?

All the officially supported deployment methods make changes to the files in the /home/site/wwwroot folder of your app. These files are used to run your app.  The web framework of your choice may use a subdirectory as the site root. For example, Laravel, uses the public/ subdirectory as the site root.
