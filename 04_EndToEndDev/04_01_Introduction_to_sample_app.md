# Introduction to the guide sample application

Instead of learning multiple sample applications, the guide focused on evolving deployment strategies. Readers could learn the sample application structure once and focus on how the application would need to be modified in order fit the deployment model.

## Sample application overview and story

ContosoNoshNow is a delivery service and logistics company focused on making delicious food accessible to their customers no matter where they are located. The company started with a simple web application they could easily maintain and add features to as the business grew. A few years later, their CIO realized the application performance and their current on-premises environment were not meeting their business's growing demand. The application deployment process took hours, yielded unreliable results, and the admin team could not easily find production issues quickly. During the busy hours, customers complained the web application was slow.

The development team knew moving to Azure could help with these issues.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription
- Git
- MySQL Workbench

## Quick start: manual Azure set up instructions

As you continue with this guide, you will be able to take advantage of the environment automation scripts that will build and configure much of your environment. It is important to understand the basic Azure **concepts** before running automated scripts. Walking through each steps will help provide additional context and learning opportunities. You will be able to create an environment in a few minutes.

>**Note:** The sample application has been tested with PHP version 7.4. **We recommend deploying to 7.4 environment**. Deploying to a 8.X requires a slightly different configuration as the underlying web server has changed.

| PHP Version | Web Server |
|-------------|----------------|
| 7.3         | Apache         |
| 7.4         | Apache         |
| 8.0         | Nginx          |

The Azure App Service uses this [Docker image](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/nginx-fpm) for its 8.0 container builds.

>**Warning**: Outdated runtimes are periodically removed from the Web Apps Create and Configuration blades in the Portal. These runtimes are hidden from the Portal when they are deprecated by the maintaining organization or found to have significant vulnerabilities. These options are hidden to guide customers to the latest runtimes where they will be the most successful. Older Azure App Service Docker images can be found [here](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/php).


## Sample application deployment steps

The deployment strategy applied in this sample application focuses on updating project environment variables instead of global environment variable configuration.

1. Log into the Azure Portal. Search for and create Azure Web App + Database resources in the Marketplace.

   - Select the Marketplace button.
  
      ![Displays the Marketplace button.](media/market-place-button.png "Marketplace button")

   - Enter `Web App + Database` in the search box.
   - Select the Microsoft Web App + Database search result.

      ![Web app + database search result.](media/microsoft-web-app-database-marketplace.png)

2. Create a web application and database.

    ![Create web app database.](media/create-web-app-database.png)

   - Choose your subscription.

   - Create a new resource group

   - Choose a region close to you.

   - Create a unique web app name.

   - Select your runtime stack.  The web app has been tested with PHP 7.4.

   - Create the resources.

3. After the resources have been deployed, locate your App Service.
  
    ![App Service](media/app-service.png)

   - Select the **Deployment Center** and capture the configuration settings.

   - In the Settings tab, choose Local Git.

    ![App Service repository options.](media/local-git.png)

   - Select **Save** at the top.

    >**Note:** Alternative Azure CLI command:

    ```cmd
    az webapp deployment source config-local-git --name <app-name> --resource-group <group-name>
    ```

   - Capture the **Git Clone Uri**. You will be pushing the application files to the Azure App Service local storage from your local machine.
  
      ![Local Git URL example](media/local-git-url.png)

   - Capture the Application Scope user and password.

     ![Application Scope user and password](media/application-scope-user-password.png)

4. Clone the sample application to your local machine from the Git repository. You are going to set up a remote to the Azure App Service repo.

   - Open the command prompt or terminal on your local machine.

   - Type

   ```cmd
   git remote add azure <your Azure App Service Git Clone URL>
   git remote -v
   git push azure master
   ```
  
   - Enter your Application Scope credentials.

   - You should see similar output.

5. Return to the Azure Portal. Navigate to the App Service. Find the **Deployment Tools** section. Log into App Service SSH terminal. Run the Composer update command in the wwwroot directory, which will import your packages and create the vendor folder, along with the autoload script (../vendor/autoload.php).

    ```bash
    cd /home/site/wwwroot
    composer.phar update
    ```
  
6. Generate Laravel application key.
  
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

7. Update the .env file with the Azure URL and save your changes.

   ```bash
    nano /home/site/wwwroot/.env
   ```

8. Open a browser and view the application.

## Connecting to the database

At this point, you are viewing the application with some sample data. The web application is not reading or writing to the database. Let's go through the steps to configure the database configuration information.

1. Capture the database connection information. Open the Azure CLI Cloud Shell and run this command.

   ```cmd
   az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group <enter your resource group> --name <enter the name of your app service>
   ```

2. Capture the following connection values:
   - Host/Server
   - User ID
   - Password
  
   >**Note:** For production environments, you would be retrieving these values from Azure Key Vault.

3. Navigate to the Flexible Server in your resource group and create `contosonoshnow` database.  

   ![](media/create-contosonoshnow-database.png)

   >**Note:** You can run these alternative commands in the App Service SSL terminal to create the database.

   ```bash
   mysql --host=<your host>-server.mysql.database.azure.com --user=<your user name> --password=<your password> --ssl=true
   ```
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE contosonoshnow
   ```

   ```bash
   exit
   ```
4. You have the database connection information now. Open the App Service SSH console and configure the **.env** project file.

   ```bash
   nano /home/site/wwwroot/.env
   ```

   ![Configure the database environment variables.](media/update-mysql-connection-info.png)

   Update the following environment variables:
   - DB_HOST
   - DB_DATABASE
   - DB_USERNAME
   - DB_PASSWORD
  
5. Run the `php artisan migrate` command to create the tables in the contosonoshnow database.

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

   ![](media/php-laravel-database-creation.png)

6. Run the `php artisan db:seed` command to seed the database with sample data values.

   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

   ![Seeded database.](media/seeded-database.png)

7. Navigate back to the web app and enter a sample order.

8. Verify your order was saved to the Flexible Server database.

## What happens to my app during an Azure deployment?

All the officially supported deployment methods make changes to the files in the /home/site/wwwroot folder of your app. These files are used to run your app.  The web framework of your choice may use a subdirectory as the site root. For example, Laravel, uses the public/ subdirectory as the site root.

The environment variable could be set globally or at the project level. Setting the environment variables at the project level, when possible, allows for deployment independence and reduces the likelihood of dependency collision.
