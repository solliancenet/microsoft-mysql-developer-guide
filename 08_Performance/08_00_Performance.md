## Monitoring Hardware and Query Performance

In addition to the audit and activity logs, server performance can also be monitored with [Azure Metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-platform-metrics). Azure metrics are provided in a one-minute frequency and alerts can be configured from them. For more information, reference [Monitoring in Azure Database for MySQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-monitoring) for specifics on what kind of metrics that can be monitored.

As previously mentioned, monitoring metrics such as the `cpu_percent` or `memory_percent` can be important when deciding to upgrade the database tier. Consistently high values could indicate a tier upgrade is necessary.

Additionally, if cpu and memory do not seem to be the issue, administrators can explore database-based options such as indexing and query modifications for poor performing queries.

To find poor performing queries, run the following:

```kql
AzureDiagnostics
| where ResourceProvider == "MICROSOFT.DBFORMYSQL"
| where Category == 'MySqlSlowLogs'
| project TimeGenerated, LogicalServerName_s, event_class_s, start_time_t , query_time_d, sql_text_s
| top 5 by query_time_d desc
```

## Query Performance Insight

In addition to the basic server monitoring aspects, Azure provides tools to monitor application query performance.  Correcting or improving queries can lead to significant increases in the query throughput. Use the [Query Performance Insight tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-query-performance-insight) to analyze the longest running queries and determine if it is possible to cache those items if they are deterministic within a set period, or modify the queries to increase their performance.

The `slow_query_log` can be set to show slow queries in the MySQL log files (default is OFF).  The `long_query_time` server parameter can alert users for long query times (default is 10 sec).

## Upgrading the Tier

The Azure Portal can be used to scale between from `General Purpose` and `Memory Optimized`. If a `Basic` tier is chosen, there will be no option to upgrade the tier to `General Purpose` or `Memory Optimized` later. However, it is possible to utilize other techniques to perform a migration/upgrade to a new Azure Database for MySQL instance.

For an example of a script that will migrate from Basic to another server tier, reference [Upgrade from Basic to General Purpose or Memory Optimized tiers in Azure Database for MySQL](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/upgrade-from-basic-to-general-purpose-or-memory-optimized-tiers/ba-p/830404).

## Scale the Server

Within the tier, it is possible to scale cores and memory to the minimum and maximum limits allowed in that tier. If monitoring shows a continual maxing out of CPU or memory, follow the steps to [scale-up to meet your demand](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-database-for-mysql/upgrade-from-basic-to-general-purpose-or-memory-optimized-tiers/ba-p/830404).

## Moving Regions

Moving a database to a different Azure region depends on the approach and architecture.  Depending on the approach, it could cause system downtime.

The recommended process is the same as utilizing read replicas for maintenance failover. However, compared to the planned maintenance method mentioned above, the speed to failover is much faster when a failover layer has been implemented in the application. The application should only be down for a few moments during the read replica failover process. More details are covered in the [Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery](03_BCDR.md) section.

## Optimization Checklist

- Monitor for slow queries.
- Periodically review the Performance Insight dashboard.
- Utilize monitoring to drive tier upgrades and scale decisions.
- Consider moving regions if the users or application needs change.
