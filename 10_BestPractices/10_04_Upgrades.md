# Azure Database for MySQL upgrade process

Since Azure Database for MySQL is a PaaS offering, administrators are not responsible for the management of the updates on the operating system or the MySQL software. However, it is important to be aware the upgrade process can be random and when being deployed, will stop the MySQL server workloads. Plan for these downtimes by rerouting the workloads to a read replica in the event the particular instance goes into maintenance mode.

> **Note:** This style of failover architecture may require changes to the applications data layer to support this type of failover scenario. If the read replica is maintained as a read replica and is not promoted, the application will only be able to read data and it may fail when any operation attempts to write information to the database.

The [planned maintenance notification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-monitoring#planned-maintenance-notification) feature will inform resource owners up to 72 hours in advance of installation of an update or critical security patch.  Database administrators may need to notify application users of planned and unplanned maintenance.

> **Note:** Azure Database for MySQL maintenance notifications are incredibly important.  The database maintenance can take your database and connected applications down for a period of time.
