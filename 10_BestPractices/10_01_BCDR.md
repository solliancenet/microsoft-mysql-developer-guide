## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

Businesses implement *business continuity* (BC) and *disaster recovery* (DR) strategies to minimize disruptions. While *business continuity* emphasizes preserving business operations through policies, *disaster recovery* explains how IT teams will restore access to data and services.

### High availability

Flexible Server implements high availability by provisioning another VM to serve as a standby. It is possible to provision this secondary Flexible Server VM in another availability zone, as shown below. This HA option is only supported for Azure regions with availability zones. While this option does provide redundancy against zonal failure, there is more latency between the zones that affects replication.

To compensate for the latency challenges, Azure provides HA within a single zone. In this configuration, both the primary node and the standby node are in the same zone. All Azure regions support this mode. Of course, it does not insulate against zonal failure.

Both of these HA solutions have transparent failover: in a failover event, the standby server becomes the primary server, and DNS records point to the new primary. If the old primary comes back online, it becomes the secondary.

Critically, note that replication is not synchronous to avoid the performance penalty of synchronous replication. A transaction committed to the primary node is not necessarily committed to the secondary node; the secondary node is brought up to the latest committed transaction during failover.

#### Implementing cross-region high availability

Flexible Server does not currently support cross-region high availability. However, it is possible to achieve this using MySQL native replication, instead of replicating log files at the Azure storage level. The image below demonstrates two Flexible Server instances deployed in two virtual networks in two Azure regions. The virtual networks are peered to provide network connectivity for MySQL native replication. As the image indicates, developers can employ MySQL native replication for scenarios like replicating from an on-premises primary to an Azure secondary.

One disadvantage of this setup is that it is customer-managed.
